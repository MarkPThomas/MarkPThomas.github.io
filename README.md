## Portfolio project

This repo contains the basic HTML & CSS code for hosting my website of portfolio projects.

The site can be viewed at [https://markpthomas.github.io](https://markpthomas.github.io)

The [https://markpthomas.github.io/wiki/index.html](wiki) portions are derived from my [https://markpthomas.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MARKPTHOMA/overview?homepageId=229583](Confluence space). I can add collaborators to the space if you wish to work on any of these projects with me.
