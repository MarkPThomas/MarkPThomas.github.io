                    <p>Are you tired of figuring out what you need for a climbing rack on trips? Especially in cam-heavy places like Indian Creek, where you may need to combine multiple racks? <a href="http://Rack.ly" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Rack.ly</a> makes trip logistics easy, whether it is by the crag, day, or entire trip.</p><p>Check out the app at my <a href="https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/rack-ly" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">GitHub repo</a>!</p><h1 id="Rack.ly-Rack.ly"><a href="http://Rack.ly" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Rack.ly</a></h1><h2 id="Rack.ly-APersonalizedandDynamicClimbingGearPlanner">A Personalized and Dynamic Climbing Gear Planner</h2><h2 id="Rack.ly-Helpingclimberspackandrackfortheirnextbigadventure.">Helping climbers pack and rack for their next big adventure.</h2><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" loading="lazy" src="attachments/721019/819764.jpeg" data-image-src="attachments/721019/819764.jpeg" data-height="274" data-width="798" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="819764" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="rackBanner.jpeg" data-base-url="https://markpthomas.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="721019" data-linked-resource-container-version="7" data-media-id="02cfa140-3ff8-43cb-9832-1bf142339dc3" data-media-type="file"></span><h2 id="Rack.ly-TheApp">The App</h2><p>Have you ever been at Indian Creek and left some badly needed cams at the car? Or how about you lugged up an enormous pack and it turned out you could have left half of the gear behind? If not, I bet you spent a LOT of time writing down the rack needed for each climb for the day, worked out Friend and Aliens sizes translated Camalots, Totems, and DMM Dragons, and tabulated the results. You sick twisted little monkey!</p><p>Well these pains of climbing at Indian Creek are now a thing of the past! By using <a href="http://Rack.ly" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Rack.ly</a>, you can update your personal rack inventory, join up with friends, select the climbs that you want to do for the day, and let the app tell YOU what you need to bring - or what you are short on. No more guessing, and more time is left for climbing!</p><p>Future versions of the app will let YOU tell <a href="http://Rack.ly" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Rack.ly</a> what rack you used to help others out. You will also be able to save plans, and have plans span multiple days out for a road trip or backpacking trip. Visit the the <a href="https://github.com/MarkPThomas/mark.ly/tree/main/packages/rack-ly" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">GitHub Repo</a> for more information on upcoming features, and how you can get involved!</p><h2 id="Rack.ly-YourProblem">Your Problem</h2><p>What is the rack that our group needs to pack for the climbing today and what we have on our agenda?</p><h2 id="Rack.ly-TheSolution">The Solution</h2><p>Easy! If you have recorded the rack you and your party has on the app, just add the routes you plan to climb and the app will tell you what you need, and most importantly, what you may be lacking.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;With this app, you can leave the kitchen sink at home.&quot;</p><p>Mark P. Thomas, app developer</p></blockquote><h2 id="Rack.ly-HowtoGetStarted">How to Get Started</h2><p>Just start up the app, fill out the gear out own, and select the climbs you want to do. It's that easy! You can save your rack and day itinerary to visit for another time as well.
